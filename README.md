**Good time to invest** is a small app that helps the potential investor to select the best timing of investing, in attempt to optimize profits (all while reducing costs).

I realize that the UI is far from "user friendly", but I'm not a frontend developer, nor did I wish to spend a lot of time making something as small as this pretty. The most important part of the app - the math - is good and tested. The code for that can be found in `math_utils.py`, and accompanying tests in `test/` directory.

For any questions, comments or similar, feel free to open a PR or contact me via email. Similar goes for adding new banks to bank preset dropdown.
